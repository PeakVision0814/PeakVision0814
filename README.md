## ℹ️ About Me

I pursued my Bachelor of Science degree in Information and Computational Science at the School of Mathematics and Information Science, Anyang Institute of Technology, from 2017 to 2021. Currently, I am a Master's student at the School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, affiliated with the Intelligent Information Processing Laboratory. My research interests span artificial intelligence, deep learning, computer vision, and medical image segmentation. My goal is to leverage AI technologies to drive innovation in medical image processing or other visual fields and address key challenges in practical applications.

This paper introduces a Linguistic-Guided Generative Large Vision Model (LiGu-LVM) to enhance the diagnostic capability of IoMT-enabled mobile ocular scanners. LiGu-LVM integrates a Dynamically Allocated High-Speed Quantization System (DAHSQS), a Linguistic-Guided Generative Local-Isolation module (LiGu), an Oculo Visio Transformatrix Segmentum-Analytica Modulorum (OVT-SAM), and a Multi-Scale Recursive Attention Segmentation Engine (MuRASE) to address challenges like low imaging quality and complex ocular morphology measurement. Experimental results demonstrate that LiGu-LVM achieves over 80% Intersection over Union (IoU) in ocular semantic segmentation, reaching 82.9% IoU on the CelebA-HQ dataset, outperforming existing models by 4.9%. This approach provides robust support for large-scale, high-precision early screening of ocular diseases in IoMT clinical environments.

This paper explores techniques for segmenting optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images under low-light conditions with vascular network topology constraints. A novel Biological Information Signal Transduction Imaging Framework (BiSTIM) is proposed, incorporating the Proteomic-Inspired Topological Segmentation (PrIS-TS) and Bio-Luminescence Adaptation (BLAAM) modules. These modules effectively address imaging artifacts, low signal-to-noise ratios, and vascular branching complexities. By achieving precise segmentation of superficial and deep retinal vascular layers, this method significantly enhances the reliability of disease diagnosis and classification, particularly in retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and hemicentral retinal vein occlusion (HCRVO) studies. Experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets, advancing the field of OCTA image segmentation and analysis.
